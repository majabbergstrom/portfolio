    <div>
      <p>Like a good game, design is stepping into a world of possibilities that you create. Having the freedom to create something from nothing or revive a tattered brand is like having the world at your fingertips with the added benefit of being able to inspire those around you.</p>
      <p>Through out my life I have gone through phases of what I wanted to be when I grew up. The only simularity between each was creativity. Each path I could have walked down was a creative one. There was never a doubt in my mind that it would be anything but that. With so much creativity in this world it is hard to not want to inpire and influence the future, even with a drawing.</p>
